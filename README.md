# renac-ble

**BLE communication library for RENAC inverters and wallboxes.**

This package provides a low-level Python API to connect to RENAC devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), parse telemetry, and send control commands.  
It is designed to be used directly or as a backend for higher-level integrations such as [renac-ha-mqtt](https://github.com/voluzi/renac-ha-mqtt).

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Discover and connect to RENAC devices over BLE
- Parse device information and runtime telemetry
- Subscribe to notifications (real-time updates)
- Send control commands (charge/discharge limits, SoC settings, export limits, ‚Ä¶)
- Async/await interface based on [bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install renac-ble
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Example
```python
import asyncio
from renac_ble import RenacInverterBLE, RenacWallboxBLE

async def main():
    inverter = RenacInverterBLE("28:9C:6E:92:7C:F6")
    wallbox = RenacWallboxBLE("E8:FD:F8:D4:A1:75")

    await inverter.connect()
    print("‚ö°Ô∏è Connected to inverter")

    info = await inverter.get_info()
    print("Inverter info:", info)

    telemetry = await inverter.get_power_and_energy_overview()
    print("Telemetry:", telemetry)

    await wallbox.connect()
    print("‚ö°Ô∏è Connected to wallbox")

    await inverter.disconnect()
    await wallbox.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```
